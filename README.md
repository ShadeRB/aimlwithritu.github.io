# MsPotatoCodeâ€™s Debug Den

Welcome to the AI/ML kitchen of MsPotatoCode â€” where data gets diced, models are baked, and results are occasionally half-baked.
Here, bugs are boiled, syntax errors are sautÃ©ed, features are baked, code experiments are served with a dash of curiosity and 
syntax errors are gently sautÃ©ed into tasty code experiments. 
Is the code perfect? Nope. But it did pass the spud check. ðŸ§ª

My Github is is still in progressâ€” come back hungry for more updates!

Last updated: May 2025 â€” still peeling back layers of logic, simmering fresh ideas, and mashing concepts as needed.
