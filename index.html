  <h1>MsPotatoCodeâ€™s Debug Den ðŸ¥”ðŸ¤–</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the AI/ML kitchen of MsPotatoCode â€” where data gets diced, models are baked, and results are occasionally half-baked.</p>
  <p>Here, bugs are boiled, syntax errors are sautÃ©ed, and code experiments are always served with a dash of curiosity.</p>
  <p>Is the code perfect? Nope. But it <em>did</em> pass the spud check. ðŸ§ª</p>
  <p>Last updated: May 2025 â€” still peeling back layers of logic, simmering fresh ideas, and mashing up concepts as needed.</p>
  <p>Siteâ€™s still cooking â€” come back hungry for more updates!</p>
